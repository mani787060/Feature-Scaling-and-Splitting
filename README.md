# Feature Scaling and Splitting

-> This project demonstrates how to apply **feature scaling** and **feature splitting** in the data preprocessing stage.  
-> Scaling ensures that features contribute equally to the model, while splitting separates the dataset into input (X) and target (y) variables.

## Topics Covered:-
-> Feature Construction
-> Feature Scaling (Normalization/Standardization)
-> Feature Splitting (X and y separation)
-> Importance of scaling before model training

## Tools & Libraries:-
-> Python
-> Pandas
-> NumPy
-> Scikit-learn

# Goal:- 
  -> To ensure clean, consistent, and well-structured data ready for machine learning pipelines.
